Hi,  I’m currently pursuing my BS at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, where I’m majoring in Data Science and Application. I'm passionate about machine learning and deep learning, with a special interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV). I'm always looking to explore new ideas and projects in these areas.

In my free time, i enjoy playing video games, reading, and music.
